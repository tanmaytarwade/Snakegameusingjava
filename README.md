Certainly! Here's a detailed description of the Snake game project:

### Project Overview

This Snake game project is a classic implementation of the popular Snake game, created using Java and the Swing framework for the graphical user interface (GUI). The game involves controlling a snake to collect cherries, growing longer with each cherry consumed, while avoiding collisions with the walls and the snake's own body.

### Main Features

1. **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**
   - Built using Java Swing, the GUI includes a game window with a fixed size.
   - The game window displays the snake, cherries, current score, best score, and game status messages.

2. **Game States**
   - **NOT_STARTED:** Initial state where the game waits for the player to start.
   - **RUNNING:** Active gameplay state where the snake moves and the player can control it.
   - **PAUSED:** Game is temporarily halted, and the player can resume it.
   - **GAME_OVER:** Game ends when the snake collides with the wall or itself, displaying the final score and an option to restart.

3. **Snake Movement and Control**
   - The snake moves continuously in the current direction (up, down, left, or right).
   - Players control the snake's direction using the arrow keys on the keyboard.
   - The snake cannot turn back on itself directly.

4. **Cherry Collection**
   - Cherries appear randomly on the game board.
   - When the snake's head intersects with a cherry, the cherry is consumed, and the snake grows longer.
   - Each cherry collected increases the player's score.

5. **Collision Detection**
   - The game detects collisions between the snake's head and the walls or its own body.
   - Collisions result in a game over.

6. **Scoring**
   - The game tracks the player's current score and the best (highest) score achieved during the session.
   - Scores are displayed on the game screen.

### Detailed Components

1. **Main Class**
   - Initializes the game window, setting the title, size, and close operation.
   - Adds the `Game` panel to the window and makes it visible.

2. **Game Class**
   - Core component managing game logic, rendering, and user inputs.
   - Initializes the game state, snake, and game timer.
   - Handles key events for starting, pausing, and controlling the snake.
   - Contains methods for updating the game state, checking for collisions, and rendering the game elements.
   - Manages the spawning of cherries and updates the score.

3. **Snake Class**
   - Represents the snake, including its head, tail, and direction of movement.
   - Manages the movement of the snake and the addition of new segments to the tail.
   - Provides methods to turn the snake and retrieve its current position.

4. **Point Class**
   - Represents a point on the game board with x and y coordinates.
   - Provides methods to move the point and check for intersections with other points.

5. **Enumerations**
   - **GameStatus:** Defines the possible states of the game (`NOT_STARTED`, `RUNNING`, `PAUSED`, `GAME_OVER`).
   - **Direction:** Defines the possible movement directions of the snake (`UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`).

### Game Mechanics

- **Initialization:** The game starts with the snake positioned in the center of the game board. The game state is set to `NOT_STARTED`.
- **Game Loop:** A `Timer` controls the game loop, periodically calling the update and repaint methods.
  - **Update:** Moves the snake, checks for collisions, and handles cherry collection.
  - **Repaint:** Renders the snake, cherries, scores, and game messages.
- **User Input:** A key listener captures keyboard inputs to control the snake and manage game states.
- **Collision Detection:** Checks if the snake's head intersects with the walls or its own tail, triggering a game over if true.
- **Cherry Spawning:** Cherries are spawned at random locations within the game boundaries, ensuring they are not too close to the edges.

### User Experience

- The game provides visual feedback on the current score and best score.
- Clear messages guide the player through the game states, indicating when the game is paused, over, or waiting to start.
- Smooth and responsive controls allow the player to navigate the snake effectively.

### Conclusion

This Snake game project is a comprehensive implementation of the classic game, featuring smooth graphics, responsive controls, and robust game mechanics. It demonstrates fundamental game development concepts using Java and Swing, including game loops, rendering, collision detection, and user input handling.
